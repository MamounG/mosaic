# mosaic
This project is about taking picture from social media 
(using a specific hashtag) and joinging them to form a bigger picture,
mosaic like.

there are 5 different projects, linked together:
- slicing: brake the main picture into masks to be used
- realTimePictureCreation: apply mask to the pictures in a specific folder, and then join them
                           into one picture to form the mosaic
- ResultAndUpload: This is where the resulting picture is stored, it is also here 
                   that the picture should be uploaded to the website
- hashtagDownload: Look for pictures in social medias, and add them to the realTimePictureCreation
                   project
- Webpage: a webpage to show the picture and the number of pictures left to finish
